\section{Longer QCM depositions}\label{long_qcm}
For larger mass loadings of the QCM, the linear approximation fails and the Z-match\texttrademark\ technique is used. This method, introduced by Lu and Lewis in 1972 on the basis of Miller and Bolef’s theoretical treatment \cite{Miller1968,Lu1972}, incorporates the acoustic properties of both the quartz and the deposited film via the acoustic impedance ratio  

\begin{equation}
	Z = \left(\frac{d_q \, \mu_q}{d_f \, \mu_f}\right)^{1/2},
\end{equation}

with $d$ and $\mu$ denoting the density and shear modulus of quartz ($q$) and film ($f$), respectively \cite{SQM160_manual}. In practice, the controller applies a correction function $f(Z)$ to the Sauerbrey relation,  

\begin{equation}
	m_f = \frac{N_{\text{AT}} \, d_q \, \pi r^2}{F_q^2} \cdot \Delta F \cdot f(Z),
\end{equation}

which compensates for the acoustic mismatch and extends the validity of thickness determination up to $\sim 0.4 F_q$.\\ 

\section{Holder Assembly Design}
\label{sec:holder_assembly_figure}

The integrated holder assembly (Figure~\ref{fig:holder_assembly}) enabled simultaneous QCM and ion probe measurements with minimal spatial separation. The aluminum mount positioned both diagnostics as close as practicable to bring the flux and plasma conditions as close as possible between measurement locations.

\section{Data Processing Workflow}\label{appendix:data_workflow}\label{appendix:data_processing}

Experimental data were processed using custom Python scripts to ensure consistency and reproducibility across all measurements. This section describes the data handling procedures and processing workflows used throughout this work.


\subsection{Data Organization and Logbook System}

A central Excel logbook served as the reference for all measurements, with each measurement identified by a unique suffix and linked to its corresponding data files. The logbook recorded:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Date and time of measurement
	\item Spatial parameters: distance from macroparticle filter (10--20~cm)
	\item Gas parameters: N$_2$ flow rate (MFC setting in sccm), working pressure (Pa)
	\item Vacuum system parameters: cryopump gate valve position, base pressure
	\item Power supply settings: arc voltage and current, EM-coil voltage and current
	\item Pulse characteristics: frequency (Hz), pulse width (ms), number of pulses
	\item QCM frequencies: initial ($f_0$) and final ($f_1$) values for mass determination
\end{itemize}

Associated oscilloscope waveforms were stored as CSV files for ion current analysis, with filenames linked to the logbook suffix for traceability.

\subsection{Ion Current Data Processing}

Ion current waveforms were recorded using a Tektronix MSO64 oscilloscope. For each measurement condition, multiple pulses were recorded and processed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Pulse averaging}: Individual pulse waveforms were averaged to obtain the mean ion current waveform.
	\item \textbf{Time-integrated current}: The mean ion current over the pulse duration (0--1~ms) was calculated by integrating the averaged waveform and dividing by the pulse width.
\end{enumerate}

The Python script automatically matched logbook entries to oscilloscope CSV files and compiled all parameters into CSV files for analysis.

\subsection{ERMS Data Processing}

Energy-resolved mass spectrometry data were evaluated with a Python script that performed the following operations:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Spectral integration}: Raw energy distribution functions (EDFs) for each $M/Q$ value were averaged over the two measurement window of 20 ms.
	
	\item \textbf{Mass transmission correction}: Applied correction factors to account for mass-dependent detection efficiency of the quadrupole mass filter and detector.
	
	\item \textbf{Energy extraction}: For each ion species ($Q = 1^+, 2^+, 3^+, 4^+$), the measured $E/Q$ distributions were multiplied by $Q$ to obtain energy distributions in eV.
	
	\item \textbf{Statistical parameters}: Mean ion energy $\langle E \rangle$, standard deviation $\sigma_E$, and peak energy $E_{\text{peak}}$ were extracted for each charge state and species.
	
	\item \textbf{Charge state analysis}: Mean charge state $\langle Q \rangle$ was calculated as a weighted average:
	\begin{equation}
		\langle Q \rangle = \frac{\sum_Q Q \cdot I_Q}{\sum_Q I_Q}
		\label{eq:mean_charge_state}
	\end{equation}
	where $I_Q$ is the integrated ion current for charge state $Q$.
	
	\item \textbf{Energy decomposition}: Total ion energy was separated into kinetic and potential components following the procedure described in \cite{decoupling_kalanov_2025}.
\end{enumerate}

	\label{fig:ERMS-appendix}
\end{figure}

The processed results were visualized and exported to CSV files for correlation with ion probe and QCM measurements. Further example plot like \ref{fig:ERMS-appendix} can be found in \ref{sec:additional plots}

\subsection{QCM Data Processing}

QCM frequency measurements were recorded before and after each set of pulses. The deposited mass was calculated using the Sauerbrey equation (Equation~\ref{eq:sauerbrey}). The mass deposition rate was obtained by dividing by the number of pulses and the active crystal area.

\section{Uncertainty Analysis}\label{appendix:uncertainty}

This section documents the uncertainty analysis for measurements reported in this work. Uncertainties were determined from three primary sources: instrument specifications, statistical variations in repeated measurements, and propagation through derived quantities.

\subsection{Primary Measurements}

\subsubsection{QCM Mass Measurements}

The QCM frequency measurements have a manufacturer-specified resolution that translates to a mass uncertainty of approximately $\pm 5.64 \times 10^{-10}$ g per measurement. This corresponds to a relative uncertainty of approximately 0.1\% for typical deposited masses. This instrumental precision is negligible compared to other uncertainty sources in this work.\\

The number of pulses (64 in most cases) was controlled digitally and has negligible counting uncertainty. The active crystal area (0.504 cm$^2$) is specified by the manufacturer due to the hole size in the QCM block with a diameter of 8~mm.

\subsubsection{Ion Current Measurements}

Ion current measurements exhibited significant variability due to the non-stationary nature of cathodic arc plasmas. The standard deviation of time-averaged current within individual pulses ranged from 33\% to 68\% of the mean value (relative uncertainty), with a mean of 45\% across all conditions measured.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Figures/experimental methods/ion_probe_voltage}
	\caption[Example ion current waveform showing variability within a pulse]{Example ion current waveform showing variability within a pulse. The voltage signal measured across the 400~$\Omega$ resistor is proportional to the ion current. Rapid transients at pulse ignition (0~ms) and termination (1~ms) are excluded from the time-averaged current calculation.}
	\label{fig:ion_current_waveform_appendix}
\end{figure}

This large variability arises from cathode spot motion and splitting or extinction events, plasma potential fluctuations during pulse ignition and termination, and charge-exchange collisions with background gas that depend on pressure. The oscilloscope (Tektronix MSO64) has a specified voltage measurement accuracy of less than 1\%, which is negligible compared to the plasma variability. Error bars on ion current measurements represent the within-pulse standard deviation and characterize the inherent variability of the arc discharge under nominally constant operating conditions.

\subsubsection{ERMS Measurements}

Mean charge states determined from energy-resolved mass spectrometry (Equation~\ref{eq:mean_charge_state}) have uncertainties ranging from 14\% to 24\% (relative), with a mean of 20\%. These uncertainties arise from statistical variations in ion energy distributions, mass transmission correction factors (estimated at $\pm 10\%$), and the energy analyzer resolution of $\Delta E/E \approx 2\%$ per manufacturer specification.\\

The reported charge state uncertainties propagate from the standard deviations of the measured energy distribution functions for each charge state, weighted by their respective ion currents.

\subsection{Derived Quantities}


Ion flux (calculated from ion current and mean charge state) has significantly larger uncertainties. For ion flux $\Phi_i = I_{\text{ion}}/(Q \cdot e \cdot A)$, the relative uncertainty is
%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sigma_{\Phi_i}}{\Phi_i} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_I}{I}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_Q}{Q}\right)^2},
\end{equation}
%
where uncertainties were propagated using standard error propagation for uncorrelated variables. This quantity is dominated by the ion current uncertainty (33--68\%) and charge state uncertainty (14--24\%), resulting in combined uncertainties of 36--72\% depending on conditions.\\

Atomic flux was calculated by converting mass flux to atomic flux using the effective molar mass (determined from film composition measured by ex-situ EDX analysis) and Avogadro's number. Since composition uncertainties were not formally characterized, the reported atomic flux values do not include propagated uncertainties.

\subsection{Uncertainties Not Quantified}

Several systematic uncertainty sources were not explicitly quantified in this work. Spatial plasma uniformity across the measurement area is estimated to contribute less than 10\% based on probe size relative to plasma diameter. Long-term calibration drift is expected to be less than 5\% as all measurements were completed within 3 months. Temperature effects on QCM sensitivity are minimal since chamber temperature remained stable within $\pm 2$~$^\circ$C and the QCM temperature coefficient is less than 0.1\% per degree. Geometric alignment uncertainties in probe positioning of $\pm 2$ cm correspond to less than 25\% flux variation at typical distances.\\

These effects are expected to be small compared to the dominant uncertainty sources identified above but were not independently characterized.

\subsection{Summary}

Table~\ref{tab:uncertainty_summary} summarizes the typical uncertainties for key measured and derived quantities. All error bars in figures represent these uncertainties unless otherwise noted. The large uncertainties in ion-based measurements reflect the intrinsic variability of cathodic arc plasmas rather than instrumental limitations.

\chapter{Langmuir Probe Bias Voltage Characterization}\label{sec:bias_characterization}

Before plasma diagnostics were performed, the functionality of the custom-built Langmuir probe was verified by characterizing the voltage-current relationship and determining the appropriate negative bias voltage for ion saturation measurements. The goal was to ensure that the probe operates in a regime where the collected current is dominated by ions, excluding contributions from electrons.

\section{Validation of Langmuir Probe Operation}

The bias voltage tests were performed without nitrogen in the chamber, at a fixed distance of 10~cm from the macroparticle filter, and with an EM-coil strength of 0.25~T. 

The relationship between the collected current $I$ and the bias voltage $V$ was analyzed using the modified Langmuir equation \cite{chen1984introduction}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:langmuir_appendix}
	I = I_{\text{sat}} \left( 1 - e^{\frac{-V}{V_0}}\right) + m \cdot V
\end{align}
where $I_{\text{sat}}$ is the saturation current and $V_0$ is a characteristic voltage. The term $m$ accounts for plasma sheath expansion and collisional effects at higher bias voltages.

Figure~\ref{fig:bias_current_appendix} displays the measured ion current as a function of bias voltage. The blue data points represent the experimental results, while the green line shows the I-V fit to Equation~\ref{eq:langmuir_appendix}.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:bias_current_appendix}
\end{figure}

\section{Analysis of the Ion Saturation Curve}

As the bias voltage increases, the sheath around the probe grows. At higher voltages, the sheath becomes non-planar, and the probe begins to attract ions not only from directly in front but also from the sides, leading to a non-saturating component in the collected current. This is a common effect seen in small probes. Additionally, collisions within the sheath or presheath region can modify the ion trajectory, resulting in a small linear increase in the collected current with voltage. The linear term $m \cdot V$ in Equation~\ref{eq:langmuir_appendix} accounts for these effects and ensures the model accurately describes the probe's behavior across the full range of applied voltages \cite[Chap.~7]{chen1984introduction}.

The experimental data were fitted to Equation~\ref{eq:langmuir_appendix} using a nonlinear least-squares method in Python, yielding the following parameters:
\[ I_{\text{sat}} = 6.17 \, \text{mA}, \hspace{2cm} V_0 = 1.8 \, \text{V}, \hspace{2cm} m = 0.023. \]

The bias voltage test results (Figure~\ref{fig:bias_current_appendix}) show two distinct regimes:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Transition Regime (0 -- 40~V):} \\
	At low bias voltages, the probe collects both ions and electrons. As the negative bias increases, more electrons are repelled, reducing their contribution to the measured current. This results in a rapid rise in net current as the ion flux begins to dominate. The transition regime is characterized by a balance between the decreasing electron flux and the increasing ion flux.
	
	\item \textbf{Saturation Regime (40 -- 130~V):} \\
	Beyond approximately 40~V, the current plateaus, indicating that the probe has entered the ion saturation regime. At this point, the negative bias effectively repels all electrons, and the collected current is dominated by ions. However, the current increases slightly with voltage, which is captured by the linear correction term $m = 0.023$ in the modified Langmuir equation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Selection of Operating Bias Voltage}

A bias voltage of $-80$~V was selected for subsequent measurements to ensure the probe operates well within the ion saturation regime. While the curve begins to saturate around 40~V, choosing a higher voltage provides confidence that the probe is fully repelling electrons and measuring ion flux reliably.

\section{Ion Current Variation over Different Pulses}\label{sec:errorbar}

To analyze the pulse-to-pulse variation, approximately 30 single pulses were recorded for each magnetic field strength. The average ion current of each pulse was calculated over the 0--1~ms pulse interval. The final mean and standard deviation were then determined by combining these averages, allowing for an assessment of the differences between pulses.

	\label{tab:pulse_measurements_appendix}
\end{table}

In all other measurements, the oscilloscope averaged the voltage signal over multiple pulses to improve signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, the error reported in subsequent sections primarily reflects variations in ion current within individual pulses, rather than differences between distinct pulses.
