\chapter{Discussion of Results}\label{chap:discussion}

 Direct comparison between ion current and deposited mass at close distances is complicated due the plasma density gradient

0.2Pa and 0.3 Pa have similar ratio but different thicknees and that s why the xrd may not line up perfectly. so gotta write that in the discussion of results
